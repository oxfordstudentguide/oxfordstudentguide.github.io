Running is the perfect exercise for students, because - as long as you have the gear to wear - it is completely free, and has no time restrictions.

### Cycling

Oxford is incredibly bicycle-friendly, and has plenty of well-marked cycle lanes and pathways throughout the city and surrounding areas. Whether you're out on a serious ride, or a more casual cruise, as long as you adhere to the rules for cyclists in *The Highway Code*, then Oxford is a very safe place to ride.

### Rowing

Rowing is one of the oldest sports in Britain, with its roots in the eighteenth century. The sport of rowing as we know it today began in 1829 with the first Oxford-Cambridge race. Being involved in rowing at some level can be very rewarding. It provides a mix of experiences that is a very special opportunity available to all students at this university.

First, being part of a crew develops skills in team work, time management, and leadership among other things. Just like doing any other sport, rowing regularly contributes to health and fitness. Furthermore, the psychological and physical challenges in preparing for a race foster fortitude and the ability to see something through. These are invaluable life lessons that will stay in a student’s life long after they graduate.

Second, the social aspect is integral to being a part of a boat club. It is a prime environment to meet new people. Club socials and crew dates are a great way to wind down from a busy day of lectures. Third, taking up rowing is extremely accessible and affordable. The boat clubs training are open to everyone no matter their athletic ability. Rowing is one of those sports that people can pick up in their first year and become very good at by the time they graduate. It is also an inexpensive activity. So being at Oxford provides a great opportunity to start rowing.And fourth, rowing is a lot of fun! The races are extremely exciting, especially the format of bumps racing. Oxford is one of the few places in the world that hosts bumps races.

But Rowing is not for everyone. For those who choose to be involved, it is a unique experience that allows for developing character, building camaraderie, meeting people, and a heck of a lot of fun.

### Oxford Half Marathon

After its initial start in 2011, the Oxford Half Marathon has grown year on year in both number of contestants and money raised. The 13.1-mile run is in aid of local Oxford charities.

The event is becoming more popular each year and takes an incredible amount of preparation and cooperation. It is all made possible by a large number of people and organisations that invest time and money into making the run both safe and enjoyable. Some of the core groups behind this are the Virgin Sport, Oxford City Council, Oxfordshire emergency services and Oxfordshire City Council, who are vital in the planning of the event. Each year a number of sponsors, varying from Lidl to Up and Running, help the day run smoothly and with as little trouble as possible.

Like all races there is also an element of competitiveness to the day. Each contestant will get a medal and t-shirt while a select few also get the chance to win a mystery prize for coming first in a selection of different categories, varying with age, gender and group quantity.

While the event is open to a limited number of runners, there is no limit to the help needed during the run. Volunteers are always desired for a variety of tasks, so if you are unable to run you can still make a difference.

### Ping!Oxford

At numerous places around Oxford you will find a table tennis table with bat and ball, on which you can play for free! Ping!Oxford is part of a national incentive to get people out and playing table tennis. The idea is to encourage people to get outdoors and have some fun.

Yet the fun doesn’t stop there; after playing numerous games with your friends you can enter tournaments organised at various sites in which you can compete whilst having a relaxing day out. Throughout the summer the tables will host friendly competitions to keep the excitement and fervor alive.
