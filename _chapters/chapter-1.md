The origins of Oxford date back to the Saxon Period. **The University of Oxford** was founded in the late 12th century; it was to be the first university in England and the oldest in the wider English-speaking world.

In February 1355, tension between the academics and local people grew, as the town vs. gown conflicts peaked in the *St Scholastica Day Riot*. What started out as a casual pub brawl ended in around 90 deaths of both scholars and townsfolk.

The next event worth knowing took place during the **English Civil War**, when Oxford temporarily served as the country’s capital and **King Charles**, who had fled from London, held court here from 1642.

Some 260 years later, **William Morris** started producing his famous tiny green cars in the city’s factories and Oxford proved itself to be invaluable as an industrial city too.

**Note:** This is not the same William Morris who founded the Kelmscott Press.

## Random Trivia

**Great Tom**, the famous bell in **Christ Church Cathedral**, strikes 101 times at 9:05pm each evening. This dates back to when the University of Oxford was founded and had 101 students, and it rang to remind each of them that the gates were about to be locked.

In 1556, three men named Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley were burnt at the stake for heresy. A memorial commemorates the event in **St Giles** however the burning took place on what is currently Broad Street.

**The John Radcliffe Hospital** is world renowned for its innovative treatments and research. A lesser known fact is that after Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin, it was then developed by three Oxford researchers during the early years of the Second World War.

**The Headington Shark** is one of the most well-known residents of Headington and was commissioned by Bill Heine in 1986. The Council have tried unsuccessfully to have it removed and even offered to re-home it!

 Oxford has more published writers per square mile than any other city in the world. Among the most famous are C. S. Lewis, who wrote *The Chronicles of Narnia*, Lewis Carroll author of *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*, J. R. R. Tolkien who famously wrote *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* and P. D. James, who wrote *The Children of Men*.

Oxford is also well-known for its famous detective, *Morse*. Colin Dexter did not reveal the detective's first name, Endeavour, until the 12th novel, keeping fans guessing for over three years.

Every member of the world famous Bodleian Library must swear an oath not to light a fire within its walls!

Scenes from Hollywood blockbuster movies have been filmed in Oxford, including: *The Golden Compass*, *Harry Potter,* *Transformers: The Last Knight* and most recently, *Tolkien.

## Outside of Oxford

Although there are hundreds of iconic things to see in Oxford, if you have a crave for travel and new experiences then here's a few ideas of attractions outside of Oxford.

### Woodstock

Woodstock is 8 miles away but seems like a different world. The quaint village boasts the **Oxford Museum** and old-fashioned tearooms, coffee shops and pubs. If you're looking for something a bit grander then look no further than the birthplace of Winston Churchill, **Blenheim Palace**. Set in 2,000 acres of beautiful parkland, walking around is a day out in itself but the house is open to visitors too. To end your day, you could take a stroll round to **St Martin's Church in Bladon**, and visit Churchill's grave; it's about half an hour walk away.

### Henley

The town of Henley dates back to the 12th Century and is based in South Oxfordshire. It is more of a trek at 24 miles away, but worth the visit. It is most famous for the Henley Regatta, first held 1839, and now annually in June; the atmosphere encompasses the whole town. You can watch the boat races or visit pop-up bars, restaurants and shops. Henley also offers boat trips down the Thames, and tours of the **River and Rowing Museum**. Just three miles out of Henley is **Greys Court**: a beautiful sixteenth century mansion and gardens. This is a must-see if you are visiting Henley.

### Chipping Norton

Chipping Norton is at the gateway to the **Cotswolds** and is a highly popular tourist town. It is worth spending the whole day wandering around and taking in the scenery. There is a vast array of antique, ceramic and glass shops, and Wednesday is market day! If you're looking for a bit of culture then the theatre hosts a variety of shows from the contemporary to classics.

### Stratford-upon-Avon

Stratford-upon-Avon is an essential visit. The birthplace of *Shakespeare* offers a multitude of things to do. You can take in a play at the **Royal Shakespeare Theatre** or do a brass rubbing at the local centre; but if you would like a more weird yet wonderful place to visit then try **The MAD museum (The Museum of Mechanical Art and Design)**. Later on in the day, ghost walks take place in the city with tales of local witches, murders and mysteries. **Student Alert!**: The Royal Shakespeare Company runs a scheme for those aged 16-25 , called **The RSC Key**, which is completely free to join and entitles you to a range of benefits, including £5 theatre tickets. If you are a student, but not aged 16-25, the company still offers benefits including cheap coach trips to see a selection of productions. In Oxford, these trips leave from the Taylorian Institute. RSC Key: https://www.rsc.org.uk/support/rsc-key/ Student section: https://www.rsc.org.uk/students-and-young-people/students

### Milton Keynes

Milton Keynes is a big contrast to the other four must-visit places. It was founded in 1967 and is now one of the UK's fastest growing city economies! If it's adventure and adrenaline you are looking for, then this is for you. As well as home to the Milton Keynes shopping centre with over 200 stores and an open market, the city boasts **Xscape**. Here you can go to the snow-dome, do some rock-climbing, or for something a bit more relaxed there is the cinema and a bowling alley!

### Bicester Village

**Bicester Village** is an outlet shopping centre located just 20 minutes from Oxford. It offers the top designer brands at discounted prices, as well as great restaurants and eateries. It also offers part-time jobs for students! If you want to visit it you can just catch the X5 bus, which stops in the city centre or take the train (listen out for the announcements in Chinese).
