### Fish and chips

Deep fried fish in a tempura style batter with a generous side portion of deep fried potato chips. Traditionally seasoned with salt and malt vinegar. This is can be accompanied by gravy, curry sauce, mushy peas or pickled onions (depending on which part of the UK you come from).

One fish and chip establishment that offers supreme portions for only a little bit more is **Posh Fish!,** located on 150 London Road, Headington, Oxford, OX3 9ED.

### The late-night kebab - Grilled lamb meat in spices.

Traditionally eaten in a pitta bread. This can be accompanied with chips, salad, mayonnaise or chilli sauce. You can find these in the evening to early morning, sold from vans (with kitchens inside them) and cost £3-5.
